# Final Project
Your mission for the final project is making your own music web application. Here are some guidelines.


## Step #1: Case study for ideation
There are numerous web-based music applications that people have created. Here are some recommended resources. 

- [Chris Lowis's Web Audio Weekly](http://www.webaudioweekly.com/) (This is particularly nice!)
- [Tone.js Demo](https://tonejs.github.io/demos)
- [Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/)
- [Awesome Audio Visualization](https://github.com/willianjusten/awesome-audio-visualization)

Find some examples that attract and inspire you. Analyze underlying ideas and techniques. Also, think about the feasibility if you make something similar. 


## Step #2: Case study presentation
Prepare 5-7 minute long presentation to introduce your favorite examples. It should include:

- Main idea
- Technical details: e.g. use of FFT, types of sound synthesis and digital audio efffect, graphic library, user interaction 
- Your plan for the final (you don't necessarily have to make strong connections to the case study)


## Step #3: Deliverable
- Submit your work to https://your_id.github.io/ctp431/final.html
- The webpage must include descriptions on the main idea and technical details (just as you did for the case study).
- Have fun with it!
